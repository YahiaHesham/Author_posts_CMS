## 🏷️ Key Decisions

- Payload CMS

I chose to install Payload CMS using the recommended method outlined in the official [Payload](https://payloadcms.com/docs/getting-started/installation) This approach ensures adherence to industry best practices, promoting a reliable and scalable setup for the project.

- TypeScript

Why TypeScript?
TypeScript is used for better type safety, enhanced development experience, and better maintainability of the code. It helps catch errors during development and ensures more predictable behavior in the codebase.
